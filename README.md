## Reproducibility Capsule for Multiphase Simulations using Flash-X

A reproducibility archive of incompressible multiphase flow simulations for the following papers:
- [A Vortex Damping Outflow Forcing for Multiphase Flows with Sharp Interfacial Jumps](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.10174.pdf)
- [BubbleML: A Multi-Physics Dataset and Benchmarks for Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14623.pdf)

The design of the lab notebook is derived from:
